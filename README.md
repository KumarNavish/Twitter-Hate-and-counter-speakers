# Analyzing the hate and counter speech accounts on Twitter

In this [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.02712.pdf) we perform  several __lexical, linguistic and psycholinguistic__ analysis on various characteristics of users involved in a tweet-reply conversation in order to study the involved behavioral complexities.

* We are planning to public the dataset once our paper is __selected__.

* Whilst following the Twitter Guidelines I had to delete some of the cell outputs beacuse they were to reveal user identity and tweet that he/she posted and that would be illegal in twitter terms.

* Please attend to each of the Ipynb files for understanding the details of our analysis, they are specifically documented for that.

* Note that this is __not__ the official page for our paper but if you are interested in our full work, please email me at navish.iitkgp@gmail.com for further craving.
