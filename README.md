# Interaction dynamics between hate and counter users on Twitter

In this [Paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3371158.3371172) we perform  several __lexical, linguistic and psycholinguistic__ analysis on various characteristics of users involved in a tweet-reply conversation in order to study the involved behavioral complexities.

* Whilst following the Twitter Guidelines I had to delete some of the cell outputs beacuse they were to reveal user identity and tweet that he/she posted and that would be illegal in twitter terms.

* Please attend to each of the Ipynb files for understanding the details of our analysis, they are specifically documented for that.

* Please note that this is __not__ the official page for our paper.
