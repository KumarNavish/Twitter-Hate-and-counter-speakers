# Interaction Dynamics of Hate and Counter speakers on Twitter

In this [Paper](https://easychair.org/conferences/submission.cgi?submission=4093468;a=20231343) we perform  several __lexical, linguistic and psycholinguistic__ analysis on various characteristics of users involved in a tweet-reply conversation in order to study the involved behavioral complexities.

* We are planning to public the dataset once our paper is [selected](https://www2019.thewebconf.org/).
* Whilst following the Twitter Guidelines i had to delete some of the cell outputs beacuse they were to reveal user identity and tweet that he/she posted and that would be illegal in twitter terms.
*Please attend to each of the Ipynb files for understanding the details of our analysis, they are specifically documented for that.
* Note that this is not the official page for our paper but if you are interested in our full work, please email me at navish.iitkgp@gmail.com for further craving.
